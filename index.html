		<h1>Weston Schnoor<h1/>
		<p style="color: blue; font-size: 18px; ">I was was raised on a farm in small town southern Iowa. At the age of 16, I started my first job at a local graphic design/ print shop, where I started off printing shirts and was then able to work my way up to installing decals and vehicle wraps. </p>
		<p style="color: blue; font-size: 18px; "> After working there all through high school, I was offered a job in the town I was about to attend college in, doing a lot of the same things I did before. I was able to train others that were hired on after me, and gain knowledge in many different areaâ€™s that would benefit me in the future.

I am now finishing up my undergrad at Graceland University with majors in Graphic Design & Business.</p>
